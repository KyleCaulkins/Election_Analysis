# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this analysis is to assist a Colorado Board of Elections employee in an audit of election results. The election results of interest are for a US congressional precinct. The data being used is a tabulated agglomeration of mail-in , punch cards, and direct recording electronic ballots. Typically, the analysis is performed using Microsoft Excel, but the process has now been automated using Python. The analysis provides total votes, votes by county, votes per candidate, and a winner of the election.

## Election Audit Results

The following is a list of election outcomes, summarized by the python script, and parts of the script related to each outcome.

-How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
-Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
-Which county had the largest number of votes?
-Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
-Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
